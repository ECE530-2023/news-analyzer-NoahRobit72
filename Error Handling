HTTP accomplishes this with five categories of status codes:

100-level (Informational) – server acknowledges a request
200-level (Success) – server completed the request as expected
300-level (Redirection) – client needs to perform further actions to complete the request
400-level (Client error) – client sent an invalid request
500-level (Server error) – server failed to fulfill a valid request due to an error with server
